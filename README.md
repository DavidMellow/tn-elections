Executive Summary
I want to look at Tennessee elections and demographics from 2000 to present (5  Presidential cycles) to see if there are noticeable trends, using both US Census and TN Secretary of State election information databases. Nationwide, women, minorities and young voters trend Democratic, but minorities and younger voters have lower participation rates. Do these trends hold for Tennessee? It’s several databases and merging and managing should be the greatest challenge.
Motivation
I have a life long interest in elections and voter participation. A democracy only works with participation. Tennessee has been skewing towards Republicans in the last several elections. Republicans currently hold the Governorship and have a supermajority in the legislature. However, the State’s two largest cities have predominantly Democratic city councils. Is there a voter tension between the two? Who is voting?
Data Question(s)
Is Tennessee’s demographic changing to the point where it will change party representation at the State level?
	-How has voter participation changed from 2000 to present?
-Have rural/urban population changes affected office holders on the National and State level?
	-Is Tennessee’s population age changing  and does that affect elections?
	-Does participation and voter selection vary by sex/race
	-Can any of this be projected for future election cycles?

Data Sources

Tennessee registered voters and turnout (may not need as may be in US Census info) https://sos.tn.gov/products/elections/election-statistics
Tennessee voter registration and participation by gender, age and race https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/voting/data/tables.All.html
Possible additionalTennessee voter demographics, time permitting. I need to create an account and explore further. https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/tennessee/party-affiliation/
Known Issues and Challenges
Merging  the individual annual datasets into one to do timelines will be the biggest challenge. I want to look at several sections of the electorate (gender, race, age, income, education, and possibly religious affiliation) so a considerable amount of time will have to be spent on visuals.
