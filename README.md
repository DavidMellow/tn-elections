Executive Summary:  
I want to look at Tennessee elections and voter participation from 2000 to the last statewide race in 2018 (5  Presidential cycles) to see if there are noticeable trends in party preference and voter participation, using both TN Secretary of State and US Census election information databases. It’s several databases and merging and managing should be the greatest challenge.

Motivation:  
I have a life long interest in elections and voter participation. A democracy only works with participation. Tennessee has been skewing towards Republicans in the last several elections. Republicans currently hold the Governorship and have a supermajority in the legislature. However, the State’s two largest cities have predominantly Democratic city councils. Is there a voter tension between the two? Who is voting? I want to explore statewide (Presidential, Gubernatorial and US Senate) elections as they represent the general electorate, rather than State Senate and State House of Representative elections which are voted for in gerrymandered districts and can produce non-proportionate representational results.  

Data Questions:  
-How has the Tennessee electorate party preference changed in statewide races from 2000-2018?
-What does voter participation look like in Tennessee and how does it compare nationally?
-Can any of this be projected for future election cycles?

Schedule (through 6/25/2020)
1.	Get the Data (5/20/2020)
2.	Clean & Explore the Data (6/1/2020)
3.	Create Presentation and Shiny App (6/17/20) - What is Shiny App?
4.	Internal Demos (6/19/2020)
5.	Demo Day (6//2020)

Known Issues and Challenges:  
Merging  the individual annual datasets into one to do timelines will be the biggest challenge. I want analyze multiple election results and levels of voter participation so a considerable amount of time will have to be spent on visuals.

Possible additionalTennessee voter demographics, time permitting. I need to create an account and explore further.   https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/tennessee/party-affiliation/
